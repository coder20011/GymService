# GymService
Nowadays since more and more people are moving towards healthy life style, so most of them prefer to go to gyms. So, it becomes more difficult to handle the user data and activities. The purpose of our gym website is to provide tools to handle users data of the website. While registering the user is asked to provide their personal information. The user can provide their height and weight and from these inputs the website will calculate their BMI. The user will also be able to calculate the total amount of calories consumed for the whole day. The gym admin will be able to map each user to a trainer. The trainer will be able to view assigned users. The user will be able to view their mapped trainer details. So, this will avoid manual errors while handling the user data.
